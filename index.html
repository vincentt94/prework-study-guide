          <ul>
              <li> CSS stands for cascading style sheets which give content style</li>
              <li> inline CSS styles an element directly in the HTML file</li>
              <li> internal style sheet embeds an entire filesheet directly in the HTML file </li>
              <li> external style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file making design changes easier </li>
              <li> a margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
              <li> a padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
              <li> a selector definse the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
              <li> declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply & the value of the property</li>

          <h2> Git</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
                <li> Git is valuable because it allows for multiple people to make separate changes to a program at the same time without getting in each others way
                <li> Github is the web interface version for Git</li>
                <li> Git Bash is the application for windowws that provides an emulation layer for a Git command experience</li>
                <li> git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
                <li> git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
                <li> " git pull origin main " pulls the remote main branch (from Github) into the local main branch (onto the laptop) </li>
                <li> " git push origin xyz "  pushes whatever changes made from our local enviroment (laptop) from the feature branch titled xyz onto Github </li>

          <h2> Javascript</h2> 
            <ul>
                <li> often abbreviated as JS, Javascript is a high level dynamic programing language that allowws users to interact with websites </li>
                <li> Variables are often used in JS to contain & store values</li>
                <li> different types of variables include: string (sequence of text), numbers, Boolean (a true/false statement), arrays ( a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference), & object ( this can be anything and all of the previous are examples of an object)</li>
                <li> const xyz = represents a variable (xyz) that CANNOT be reassigned</li>
                <li> let xyz = represents a variable (xyz) that CAN be reassigned often used within a FOR loop</li>
                <li> FOR loops usually have 3 parts: the starting point, the condition, & the final statement</li>
                <li> console.log (xyz) =  outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument, it will output whatever is within the parentheses</li>
                <li> === is a strict equality operator which checks to see if two values are equal & returns a boolean results (true/false); true if value are equal, false if values are not equal</li>
                <li> within arrays, length is used to determine the amount within an array</li>
                <li> example)
                  
                  const topics = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Git', 'Javascript'];

                  for ( let x = 0; x < topics.length; x++ )
                       {console.log(topics[x]);
                  
                       } </li>
                <li> in the above example, topics is the variable with an array of data including HTML, CSS, Git, & Javascript; the topics.length segment represents the length of the array topics</li>

          <h2> VS code to Github</h2>
            <li> Updates made from VS code must be transfered correctly to Github</li>
            <li> git status ---> shows us what branch we are currently in
            <li> git checkout -b abc ----> creates and moves us to a feature branch named abc </li>
            <li> git add -A ---> commits all files into the working feature branch</li>
            <li> git commit -m "abcdefghijk" ---> -m is used to associate a message with our commmit, the actual commmit is within the parentheses (abcdefghijk)</li>
            <li> git pull origin main ---> pulls in base branch from VS </li>
            <li> git push origin abc ---> pushes changes made from feature branch abc into Github repo</li>
            <li> Now we must create a Pull Request on Github, to merge feature branch abc (compare) into the main branch (base)</li>
            <li> Add a title & short description to the PR</li>
            <li> Now you can merge the new feature branch into the main branch (this is usually checked by a peer prior to merging)</li>
